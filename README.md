## Description This project is a general practical exercise designed to introduce the basics of computer networking. The goal is to learn how to configure IP addresses, connect devices through routers, and understand the role of a gateway within a network by solving 10 non-functioning network levels.

## Instructions 1. **Execution:** Download the project files, extract them, and run the index.html file in a web browser[cite: 76, 204]. 2. **Browser Requirement:** Use Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser; Firefox is known to block usage[cite: 91]. 3. **Usage:** Enter your intranet login to practice with your personal configuration in the "Training" tab[cite: 93]. 4. **Exporting:** Use the **[Get my config]** button to download your configuration once a level is successfully completed[cite: 146, 214].

## Submission Details

To complete the assignment, 10 exported configuration files (one per level) must be placed at the root of the Git repository[cite: 205, 212].

## Resources

* **Networking Concepts Studied:** TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routers, switches, and the OSI layers[cite: 203].


* **AI Usage:** AI was used as a thought partner to explain complex subnetting logic, troubleshoot "KO" errors (such as "No reverse way" and "Multiple destination hosts match"), and clarify the binary mathematics required for CIDR masks.
