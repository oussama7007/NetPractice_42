Description
Clearly present the project, its goal, and a brief overview.


Goal: To introduce the basics of computer networking, including configuring IP addresses, connecting devices through routers, and understanding the role of a gateway.


Overview: Solving 10 levels of non-functioning network diagrams via a training interface to make them function properly by adjusting unshaded configuration fields.






*Instructions*

Execution: Download the project files, extract them, and run the index.html file in a web browser.

Browser Requirement: It is strongly recommended to use Google Chrome or a Chromium-based browser, as others like Firefox are known to block its usage.


Usage: Enter your intranet login to practice with your personal configuration in the "Training" tab, or use the "Evaluation" tab for random configurations.


Exporting: Use the [Get my config] button to download your configuration once a level is successfully completed.



***Submission Details***
To complete the assignment, 10 exported configuration files (one per level) must be placed at the root of the Git repository.

*Resources*

Networking Concepts Studied: TCP/IP addressing, subnet masks, default gateways, routers, switches, and the OSI layers.


AI Usage: AI was used as a thought partner to explain complex subnetting logic, troubleshoot "KO" errors (such as "No reverse way" and "Multiple destination hosts match"), and clarify the binary mathematics required for CIDR masks.
